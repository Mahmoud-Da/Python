*** 1- Pypi ***

- In the last section we explored python standard library. Now even though this library is very
comprehensive, it doesn't have everything that we potentially need when building a real application.

- There are times that we need features not implemented in python standard library.
That's where pypi or python package index comes into picture. Pypi is like npm or node package
manager for javascript developers. It's basically a repository of python packages built by people
like us.

- So if we head over to pypi.org, on this page we can see that currently we have
almost 600,000 projects registered in this repository.

- For pretty much anything we imagine,
there is a python package here. Let's say we want to work with pdf files in our application.

- simply search for pdf. As we can see currently we have over 2,000 projects for working with pdf
files. Here are a few examples. This first package is a two-dimensional barcode generator.
We also have this package for managing and processing pdf files. 

- The next one is for converting a pdf file to text. We can also convert a pdf to image and so on. So we have tons and tons of packages for
working with pdf files. Of course not all of these are useful, some of them are buggy or incomplete,
but if we do a little bit of research, we can find a good and stable package for our projects.


- Alternatively, we can also google the best python packages for working with pdf files and see what
other people in the community say. So in this section we're going to learn about all the tooling we need
to install these packages and publish our own packages to this repository.
