*** 1- Introduction ***
- In this section we're going to look at some of the most
popular packages in the Python community. So we're going to learn how to work with
Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, send text messages,
automate browsers, scrape websites, and so on.

- These have a lot of applications in the real world. Now before we get started, we just
want to let we know that we're only going to look at the basics of these packages because
each of these packages has so much detail that goes beyond the scope of this course.

- we need to look at their documentation to learn these additional details on our own.
So in this section we just want to know what is out there for us and how we can use it.
