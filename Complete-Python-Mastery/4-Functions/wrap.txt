*** 1- Defining Functions ***
So Far we have learned how to use some of the built-in functions in Python such as print round and so on in this section
we're going to learn how to write our own functions now.

- why do we even need to write our own functions?
when we build a real program that program is going to consist hundreds or thousands of lines of code
we shouldn't write all that code in one file like we have done so far
we should break that code into a smaller more maintainable and potentially more reusable "chunks"
we refer to these "chunks" as "functions". 


- how to create our own custom functions?
We start with the "def" keyword which is short for define
Next we need to give our function a name, So let's call this greet.

PS: all the best practices we learned about naming our variables also apply to naming our functions
So make sure our function names are meaningful
Descriptive use lowercase letters to name our functions and an underscore to separate multiple words

Now after the name we need to add
Parenthesis we will see why shortly and then we'll add a colon now what is going to happen?

we know it we're going to get indentation which means the following statements will belong to this function
we add two statements
Both these lines belong to this function because they're indented
-------------------code----------------------
def greet():
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")
-------------------code----------------------

Now we're done with this function. We need to call it
So we remove the indentation and  adding two line breaks after this function This is what pep 8 recommends
to keep our code clean and maintainable.


we call this function greet with parentheses just like how we call the built-in functions.
-------------------code----------------------
def greet():
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")


greet()

=> Hi there
Welcome aboard
-------------------code----------------------

*** 2- Arguments ***
What is the difference between the greet and Print functions?
the difference is that this print function takes an input
Whereas our greet function doesn't take any inputs.

- how to pass inputs like first name and last name to this function.
When defining a function in between parentheses will list our parameters
So here we add two parameters like first underline name and last underline name
Now when calling this function, we need to supply two values for those parameters. We refer to them as arguments
so "Moody Lili" these are the arguments to the greet function
-------------------code----------------------
def greet(first_name, last_name):
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")


greet("Moody", "Lili")
-------------------code----------------------


difference between parameters and arguments.
- parameter: is The input that you define for our function.
- argument: is the actual value for a given parameter.

now instead of saying hi there
We can greet a person by their full name so we can convert it to a formatted string and
Pass two fields here first name as well as last name
-------------------code----------------------
def greet(first_name, last_name):
    print(f"Hi {first_name} {last_name}")
    print("Welcome aboard")


greet("Moody", "Lili")

=> Hi Moody Lili
Welcome aboard
-------------------code----------------------




This function is more useful. We can reuse it and call it with different arguments. 
So let's greet John Smith as well
-------------------code----------------------
def greet(first_name, last_name):
    print(f"Hi {first_name} {last_name}")
    print("Welcome aboard")


greet("Moody", "Lili")
greet("John", "Smith")

=> Hi Moody Lili
Welcome aboard
Hi John Smith
Welcome aboard
-------------------code----------------------

note: by default all the parameters that you define for a function are required
So here our greet function takes two parameters if I exclude one of these arguments and save the changes
You can see we have this red on the line
Spylent is complaining and saying
-------------------code----------------------
No value for argument 'last_name' in function call
-------------------code----------------------

Also, if we run the program we get this 
-------------------code----------------------
Type error greet missing one required positional argument
-------------------code----------------------
