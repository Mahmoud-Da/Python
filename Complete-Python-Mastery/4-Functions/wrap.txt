*** 1- Defining Functions ***
So Far we have learned how to use some of the built-in functions in Python such as print round and so on in this section
we're going to learn how to write our own functions now.

- why do we even need to write our own functions?
when we build a real program that program is going to consist hundreds or thousands of lines of code
we shouldn't write all that code in one file like we have done so far
we should break that code into a smaller more maintainable and potentially more reusable "chunks"
we refer to these "chunks" as "functions". 


- how to create our own custom functions?
We start with the "def" keyword which is short for define
Next we need to give our function a name, So let's call this greet.

PS: all the best practices we learned about naming our variables also apply to naming our functions
So make sure our function names are meaningful
Descriptive use lowercase letters to name our functions and an underscore to separate multiple words

Now after the name we need to add
Parenthesis we will see why shortly and then we'll add a colon now what is going to happen?

we know it we're going to get indentation which means the following statements will belong to this function
we add two statements
Both these lines belong to this function because they're indented
-------------------code----------------------
def greet():
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")
-------------------code----------------------

Now we're done with this function. We need to call it
So we remove the indentation and  adding two line breaks after this function This is what pep 8 recommends
to keep our code clean and maintainable.


we call this function greet with parentheses just like how we call the built-in functions.
-------------------code----------------------
def greet():
    print("Hi there")
    print("Welcome aboard")


greet()

=> Hi there
Welcome aboard
-------------------code----------------------
