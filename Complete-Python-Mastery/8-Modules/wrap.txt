*** 1- Creating Modules ***

- So far we have written all our code in one file, app.py
But that's not how we build real programs, because a real program can contain
tens of thousands of lines of code. We don't want to write all that
code in one file. 

- That is like going to a supermarket without any
sections. All products are in one place. Finding a product in a
supermarket like that is really hard, right? That's why in supermarkets
we have various aisles or sections or departments.

- We have the same concept in programming. So as our program grows, we should split
our code across multiple files. We refer to each file a
module. So a module is a file that contains some python code.

- Now here's a question, how do we decide what functions or what classes
we should put in what modules? Once again, let's go back to our supermarket
example. In a supermarket, each section contains highly
related products. So when we go to the fruit section, we only see fruits.
You don't see cleaning products there, right?
By the same token, a module should contain highly related objects.

- These objects can be functions, classes, variables, and so on.
So here, as an example, we have defined two functions. These functions have
no implementation, but they are both highly related to the concept of sales.
-------------------code----------------------
def calc_tax():
    pass


def calc_shipping():
    pass
-------------------code----------------------

- We have calculate tax and calculate shipping. So let's go ahead
and put these functions in a separate
module called sales  Here in the project folder, we're going to add a new file
and call it sales.py and This is our sales module.

- Note that in terms of naming convention, just like variables and functions,
we use all lowercase letters, and if we have multiple words, we separate them
using an underscore.

- Now, back to app.py, let's get all this
code, and move it to sales module. Okay, now back to the app module. We need to import
one or two functions from our sales module.

- There are a couple of different ways to achieve this. You have seen one way
before, so we start with from, then we add the name of our module, which is sales.

- Note that it's not sales.py, it's only the name of the file.
So from sales import, now if we press control
and space here, we can see all the objects defined in this
module. Currently we have these
two functions, as well as a bunch of variables that python automatically
creates. We'll look at these later.

- So let's say we want to import the calculate shipping function, there we
go. Now we can call this function just like a function that we have defined
in our app module. So calculate shipping. As simple as that.
-------------------code----------------------
from sales import calc_shipping

calc_shipping()
calc_tax()
-------------------code----------------------
 
- Now if we want to import multiple objects from a module,
we can separate them using a comma.
-------------------code----------------------
from sales import calc_shipping, calc_tax
-------------------code----------------------

- So here we can also import calculate tags, and then
call it here. Now there are some tutorials out there that teach us a
shortcut to import multiple objects using an asterisk.
-------------------code----------------------
from app1_sales import *
-------------------code----------------------

- While this makes our code shorter, it's actually a bad practice.
Because in that module we could have several different functions or variables,
and if we blindly import them into the current module, some of those
objects may overwrite the objects with the same name in the
current module. 
So don't import all objects like this. Only import the stuff that we need.

-   There is also another way to import
a module. Instead of starting with from, we start with import,
and then we add the name of the module. Now
in this module we have an object called sales, and we can use
the dot operator to access
its members. 
-------------------code----------------------
import sales
-------------------code----------------------

- So our calculate shipping function is now a method
in this object. And we call it like this.
-------------------code----------------------
sales.calc_shipping()
sales.calc_tax()
-------------------code----------------------

- So basically we can either import the entire module as an object,
or we can import specific objects from that module. What approach
we choose is purely our personal preference, there is no right or wrong here. There's
not even a performance difference.
 Because whenever we want to import one object from a module, that entire module needs
to be loaded. Now we can pick one object, or every object in that module.

*** 2- Compiled Python Files ***
- So these are the files or modules we currently have in this folder. We have
app.py which is our main module or the entry point to our program
as well as the sales module.

- Now when we run this program.
-------------------code----------------------
python3 app2.py
-------------------code----------------------

- we will see a new folderSo python app.py
There we go. We have this new folder pycache and in this folder we have the compiled version
of the modules that we import into our program.


- So currently we have the compiled version of the sales module. The reason
python stores these compiled files in this folder is to speed up module
loading. So next time we run our program, python will look at the content
of this folder and if we do have the compiled version of the sales
module, python will simply load that compiled version. So it will skip
that compilation step and this will result in faster
loading of the sales module. 

- Note that it only speeds up the loading of this module, not the actual
performance of the application. Now how does python know if this compiled
version is up to date with the latest code in the sales module? Well,
it basically checks the date time of these two files "sales.py" and "app2.py", the
compiled version as well as the source code. 

- If the date time of this source file is newer, it
realizes that our source code is changed so it will recompile it and store it
in this pycache folder.

- So that's the basic idea. Now this c python 313 we see in the file name here
represents the python implementation used to compile this file.
-------------------code----------------------
sales.cpython-313.pyc
-------------------code----------------------

- So we have compiled this file using c python version 3.13 In this file we have
python bytecode, So when we click on the compiled file, by default
vscode doesn't show the content of this file because it's binary.

- But if we click "Open anyway", we can see the python bytecode
representation of our sales module.

- Now back to this pycache folder, note that we don't have the compiled version
of the app module, because python always re-compiles the module
that we load directly from the command line.

- So in this demo we passed
app2.py as the entry point to python and that's the reason python didn't
cache the compiled version of this module.

*** 3- Module Search Path ***
- So here in app3.py, we're currently importing the sales module.
-------------------code----------------------
import sales
-------------------code----------------------
-  When python sees this, it will look for a file called sales.py in the current directory.

- If it doesn't find this file, it will look in a bunch of predefined directories that
come with python installation. 

- to see that, So, we have a built-in module called path, let's import that.
In this module, we have a variable, path, which returns the list of directories that python will look at to find a module.
Let's print this on the terminal.
-------------------code----------------------
import sys

print(sys.path)
# ['Python/Complete-Python-Mastery/8-Modules', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python313.zip', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/lib-dynload', '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages']
-------------------code----------------------

- So as we see, we get an array of strings, the first element in this array represents the current folder.
-------------------code----------------------
'Python/Complete-Python-Mastery/8-Modules'
-------------------code----------------------

- After that, we have library, frameworks, python framework, version 3.13.
-------------------code----------------------
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python313.zip'
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13'
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/lib-dynload'
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages'
-------------------code----------------------

- Again, this is going to be different on our machine depending on our operating system. we're using mac, so this is the address of python installation on macOS.
On windows, we're probably going to get something like c drive, backslash program files, python, blah, blah, blah.

- So when python sees an import statement, it will search all these directories to find this module.
As soon as it finds the module, the search stops there.

- Now, we might be curious how we can import a module from a subdirectory.
Well, to do that, we need to look at packages, and that's the topic for the next lecture.
For the next lecture.
