*** 1- Python Standard Library ***

- Python has a batteries included philosophy, which means it comes with a comprehensive library of
packages and modules that provide common features that we need when building real applications.

- So in this section, we're going to explore Python standard library. More specifically,
we're going to learn how to work with files and directories, SQLite databases,
date and time objects, generate random values, send emails, and so on.

- As we go through this section, don't worry about memorizing anything. Just try to get an idea what is where and what we
can do. we can always come back to this section and treat it as a reference. 

- For example, if in the future we want to generate random values, we can come back and watch the corresponding lecture.
