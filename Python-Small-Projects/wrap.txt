*** 2-Dice Rolling Game ***
Problem:
- First we get this question, roll the dice.
-------------------code----------------------
Roll the dice? (y/n):
-------------------code----------------------

- Here we have only two options, yes or no.
If we type anything else, we get an error message saying invalid choice.
-------------------code----------------------
Roll the dice? (y/n): z   
Invalid choice!
-------------------code----------------------

- Now we can type a y, either lower case or upper case, it doesn't matter.
And every time we get two new random numbers, just like how we roll a dice.
-------------------code----------------------
Roll the dice? (y/n): Y
(2, 5)
Roll the dice? (y/n): y
(4, 1)
-------------------code----------------------

- Now if we type n, our program terminates and displays a message saying thanks for playing.
-------------------code----------------------
Roll the dice? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
-------------------code----------------------

Solution:
- Before we jump into coding, we always take a moment to map out what we want to do. Kind
of like checking a map before we start a road trip. It helps us to see the big picture and
avoid getting lost along the way.


-  So let's quickly plan our approach before we start
writing any code. it makes things much smoother. So in this python file, we're
going to use comments to map out how this program should behave. 

- So first we should ask the user a question, like roll the dice, then we should check the user input. So if
user enters y, then we should generate two random numbers and print them. Otherwise, if the
user enters no, then we should print a thank we message and terminate the program. Otherwise,
if the user types anything else, we want to print an error message like invalid choice.
Now we want to make sure that the user can keep playing until they decide to terminate the
game. So we should put these instructions inside a loop for repetition. So everything here should
go inside a loop, an infinite loop.
-------------------code----------------------
# Loop
# Ask: roll the dice?
# If user enters y
# Generate two random numbers
# Print them
# If user enters n
# Print thank you message
# Terminate
# Else
# Print invalid choice
-------------------code----------------------

- Okay? Now let's start converting these comments into
actual code. So first we're going to ask the user to roll the dice and to do that we use
the input function. Now here we should type a prompt, we can use double quotes or single
quotes, different people have different preferences. Whatever we like, just make sure to stick to
that. So here we're going to ask, roll the dice and give the options yes or no. We add a colon
followed by a white space, so whatever the user types will be separated from our prompt.
finally store the result in a variable, we can call it choice.
-------------------code----------------------
# Loop
choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
# If user enters y
# Generate two random numbers
# Print them
# If user enters n
# Print thank you message
# Terminate
# Else
# Print invalid choice
-------------------code----------------------

- Okay? Now we'll  Next we should check
if choice equals y. So if choice equals a lowercase y or choice equals an uppercase y.
-------------------code----------------------
if choice == 'y' or choice == 'Y':
-------------------code----------------------

- that's one way to do this, but there is a smarter way. We can treat whatever the user types as
lowercase. So look, if we hover our mouse over this choice variable, look at the type,
the type is a string. So the input function returns a string and we know that in python,
string objects have a bunch of methods. So here we can use the lower method to convert
whatever the user types into lowercase. 
With that we can get rid of the second condition.
-------------------code----------------------
choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
  if choice == 'y':
-------------------code----------------------

- Okay? Now we should generate two random numbers. And to do that, first we have to import
the random module. Now in this module we have a method, we can call random.randint to generate
a random integer or a random number between these two numbers, a and b. In this case,
1 and 6. Now this returns a random number, so we store it in a variable like die1. Now we
have to repeat this to generate the second random number.
-------------------code----------------------
import random

choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
if choice == 'y':
    die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
    die2 = random.randint(1, 6)
-------------------code----------------------

- Next we should print these numbers.
So here we call print. Now for simplicity, we can use a formatted or an f string. So we
type an f before our quotes. And here we add parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we want
to print our random numbers like 1 and 2. But instead of hard coding these numbers, we
want to print the actual random numbers that are generated here. So we replace one with curly
braces to add a placeholder or a hole in our string. And inside this hole, we add die1. And
similarly, replace two with curly braces and add die2. So we print these numbers.
-------------------code----------------------
print(f'({die1}, {die2})')
-------------------code----------------------

- Next we should check if the user types an n. So elif choice equals n, then we want to print a thank
we message. So thanks for playing. Now to terminate the
program, we want to break out of our loop. Now we haven't added the loop here, so
on the top, now there are two ways to do this. Some people like to declare a variable
like running or playing and initialize it to true. Then
they add it as the loop condition. So while playing is true, then we're going to
repeat these instructions. And when the user types an n, we can use the break
statement to jump out of this loop.
-------------------code----------------------
playing = True

while playing:
    choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
    if choice == 'y':
        die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
        die2 = random.randint(1, 6)
        print(f'({die1}, {die2})')
    elif choice == 'n':
        print('Thanks for playing!')
        break
-------------------code----------------------

- That's one way, but there is a better way.
This variable here is really unnecessary. So we can use true as the condition for this
loop and get rid of one extra line of code. Also note that it's a good practice to add a line break
between our import statements and the rest of the code. It makes our code cleaner
and easier to the eyes.
-------------------code----------------------
while True:
    choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
    if choice == 'y':
        die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
        die2 = random.randint(1, 6)
        print(f'({die1}, {die2})')
    elif choice == 'n':
        print('Thanks for playing!')
        break
-------------------code----------------------

- Now finally,
if the user types anything else, we want to print an error message. So print
invalid choice. As simple as that. That was our first project.
-------------------code----------------------
import random


while True:
    choice = input('Roll the dice? (y/n): ').lower()
    if choice == 'y':
        die1 = random.randint(1, 6)
        die2 = random.randint(1, 6)
        print(f'({die1}, {die2})')
    elif choice == 'n':
        print('Thanks for playing!')
        break
    else:
        print('Invalid choice!')
-------------------code----------------------
